Sudoku Solver in AI

This was a sudoku solver that was made as part of a mini project for my AI class in 2nd year of Engineering
We attempted and implemented a Sudoku Solving AI using backtracking.

There is also a GUI implementation of the same implemented with pygame wherein you can interact and play the game with the solver running in the background.
The solver checks each input by the player and only fills square if it is correct else a cross is displayed at bottom.
